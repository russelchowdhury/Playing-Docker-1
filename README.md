# Getting Started 1

Here one will find a simple get started guideline and projects used to work with the guide. 

There will be many ways to start playing with Docker. I followed docker's official get started guideline. 

My dependencies was: 

Windows 10 Enterprise, Docker Desktop for Windows, Windows Power Shell terminal in Admin mode, Hyper-V Manager.

Here is the link to follow:

[Get Started with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

In a nutshell, The Docker Get Started Tutorial teaches you how to:

1. Set up your Docker environment 
2. Build an image and run it as one container
3. Scale your app to run multiple containers
4. Distribute your app across a cluster
5. Stack services by adding a backend database
6. Deploy your app to production


Note: 
1. Issues : I have faced an issue on running Docker after installation was solved by dealing with Hyper Manager feature unchecked>restart pc>checked>restart pc>run docker;
   Expected reason: I successfully installed Docker few months before with Hyper Manager features, some how it may be cached something compatibility of previous docker version with current Hyper Manager. That's the reason for not running the Docker Daemon.
